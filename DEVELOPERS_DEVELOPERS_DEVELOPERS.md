# building and testing locally

The `ciclops` GitHub Action runs using a Docker container that encapsulates the
Python script that does the CI test analysis.

## Developing and testing

You can test directly with the Python code on the `example-artifacts` directory,
where you can see some JSON artifacts in the expected format. For example:

``` shell
python summarize_test_results.py --dir example-artifacts
```

You can build the container with

``` shell
docker build -t gh-ciclops .
```

To get a better idea of how *ciclops* will work when used in GitHub workflows,
it is useful to run locally with `act`. See
[*act* homepage](https://github.com/nektos/act) for reference.

In the `.github/workflows` directory in this repo, you will find a test YAML
workflow file you can run with `act`.

**WARNING**: to test with `act`, take care to use the `-b` option to **bind**
the working directory to the Docker container. The default behavior of copying
will not work properly (at least at the time of testing this, September 2022.)

`act` does not have direct support for the GitHub Job Summaries.
See [`act` issue for GH job summary](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/1187).
As a workaround, we can use the `--env` option. Example:

``` shell
act -b --env GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY='github-summary.md'
```

Running this should create a file `github-summary.md` with the test summary.

## How it works

The files in this repository are needed for the Dockerfile to build and run, of
course. In addition, GitHub will copy the files in the **user's** GitHub
workflow location to the Dockerfile too. This is how the folder with the JSON
artifacts will get passed. When invoking with `act`, we are simulating this with
the `-b` option.

In the Dockerfile, the `COPY . .` line will include the directory with the
JSON test artifacts at build time.
See [GitHub support for Dockerfile](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/dockerfile-support-for-github-actions):

> Before the action executes, GitHub will mount the GITHUB_WORKSPACE directory
> on top of anything that was at that location in the Docker image and set
> GITHUB_WORKSPACE as the working directory.

**NOTE**: the behavior of the `COPY` command in Dockerfiles seems quite
finicky on whether it's done recursively or not. The invocation used,
`COPY . .`, ensured that the copy was recursive.
